"""Shareable receipts and Town Proof.

Full bodies, prompts, and sensitive traces stay in the bundle. A
receipt is a deliberately sanitized derivative: the exact claim,
digests, evidence references, observer, time window, coverage, and
limitations, signed when it crosses organizational boundaries. The
signature proves that a named key committed to those exact bytes; it
does not prove the observation was true, the observer was independent,
or the agent was safe.

Town Proof is a scoped view over a verified receipt: one capability
observed under one exact profile, release basis, observer, window, and
coverage. Narrow and expiring by construction; never a universal
reputation score.
