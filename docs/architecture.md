# Architecture

One Python package, three testing modes, one evidence pipeline. The website
dashboard is a separate Next.js application; its catalog does not execute agents.

## The evidence pipeline

All three modes end with a bundle directory holding the five
records (profile, run, intents, events, result) plus a manifest of
hashes and a rendered report. The evaluator or validator judges from
the frozen profile and exported events, so `verify` can recompute every hash and
replay the judgment. In the Lab, privacy redaction runs before
evaluation, so the recorded result is reproducible from public records
by construction. Verification compares deterministic evaluation output, not the
evaluation wall-clock timestamp. Path selects its evaluator from the pinned
profile; Track replays a recorded `0.2.0` or `0.3.0` result under the rules
that produced it, alongside the current `0.4.0`. Any other evaluator version
difference is reported explicitly; stored results are not silently upgraded.

Replay is only as exact as the version label. Two early commits changed what
Track `0.2.0` records without a new version: `6e7529b` reworded the
`portable_identity` note, and `f46edce` began recording a stage that lacks
evidence after a failed stage as `not_tested`, not reached, instead of
`not_enough_evidence`. Every bundle from before the first, and each failing run
from before the second in which such a stage followed the failure, report an
evaluator replay mismatch although the verdict still agrees. Any change to what
an evaluator records needs a new version, and each version's rules are kept, by
that version, for as long as its bundles should replay.

The root commits the five named record files only. Reports, receipts,
attestations, viewer HTML and participant state are side artifacts. A receipt
can be valid with partial coverage; the local TOWN-TESTED view additionally
requires full coverage, a passed verdict, freshness and verified evidence.
Signatures prove key commitment, not the truth of the underlying observations.

## Determinism rules (Lab)

No wall clock and no unseeded randomness inside a run. Time is logical.
The event queue orders by (time, insertion sequence). Iteration is over
lists and sorted views, never bare sets or unsorted dicts, wherever
order reaches the logical trace. Run IDs, generated identities and wall-clock
creation/evaluation metadata can differ between attempts. Determinism means
repeatable logical behavior and evaluation under controlled inputs, not
byte-identical evidence bundles or interchangeable fingerprints.

## Trust boundaries (Track)

The coordinator owns mailbox state and coordination facts. It stores join/session
credentials and identity pins; controller private keys remain in the operator
keystore. Participants own their state directories and journals. Separate local
processes are not a security sandbox for hostile commands or plugins.
Runner observations (crash, restart, exit codes) are posted as events
attributed to the runner. The model tool loop exposes `list_participants`,
`claim_work`, `send_work`, `ack_work` and `finish`; its harness owns joining and
the HTTP session. The MCP server separately wraps the participant HTTP surface.
Run creation and fault plans are admin-only.
A grant's permissions (join, claim, send, ack) are checked at join and
on every mailbox action; a role pinned to a portable identity can join
only through its grant, never with a bare token. Pinned identities and
session permissions live in the database, so both hold across a
coordinator restart. Denials are recorded as intents plus
`grant_permission_denied` (or `grant_required`) events.

Grant time validity is checked at join. Existing sessions are not a general
revocation/continuing-expiry mechanism; a future authority-lifetime change needs
an explicit contract and migration policy. Model-provider credentials and custom
process environment behavior are separate from Town session permissions.

Bundled processes receive only runtime configuration and their test credentials;
hosted-model harnesses also receive the configured model key, URL and standard
proxy variables. Scripted and mock harnesses do not need those credentials.
Explicit custom commands retain their ambient environment and run with the
operator's privileges. On POSIX, the runner signals its process groups before
export; other platforms currently settle only direct children. This is bounded
lifecycle cleanup, not hostile-code isolation.

Bundled harness provenance describes the module Town launched. Operator-supplied
commands, separately joined participants and external A2A participants instead
record their connector kind and an explicitly unrecorded immutable release basis.
Their rerun metadata omits raw commands and endpoint URLs and identifies inputs
the operator must resupply; it must not silently replace them with stock agents.
This metadata is not a secret scanner for arbitrary participant events.

## Path boundary

Path acts as a deterministic requester of an existing A2A agent. A direct URL
or a local JSON fixture supplies the locator; the latter is not an actual NANDA
Index integration. An optional expected AgentCard digest permits a consistency
comparison. Without it that stage is not tested.

The native transport limits response bytes and rejects redirects and nonidentity
encodings. HTTPX phase timeouts are not total wall-clock deadlines. Explicit
remote/LAN endpoints remain supported. The synthetic quote checks do not verify
real payments or establish complete A2A protocol conformance. See the
[testing guide](testing-an-existing-agent.md) and [proposal mapping](convergence.md).

## Extending the town

- New layer plugin: `@register("payments", "yourledger.v1")` on a class
  taking the engine, then name it in a scenario under `layers:`.
- New scenario: a YAML file with agents, roles, faults, seed; run it by
  path, and add a validator under `sim/validators.py` with
  `@validator("your-name")` for stage verdicts.
- New role: `@role("your-role")` on a SimAgent subclass in
  `sim/agents.py`.
- Your own agent on the Track: speak the coordinator HTTP contract
  (`nandatown coordinator`); the examples and exported schemas describe the
  current boundary. The schema exporter covers the listed concepts, not every
  HTTP route or every internal model.
